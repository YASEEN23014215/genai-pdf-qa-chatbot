## Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain

### AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In many cases, users need specific information from large documents without manually searching through them. A question-answering chatbot can address this problem by:

1. Parsing and indexing the content of a PDF document.
2. Allowing users to ask questions in natural language.
3. Providing concise and accurate answers based on the content of the document.
  
The implementation will evaluate the chatbot’s ability to handle diverse queries and deliver accurate responses.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Load and Parse PDF
Use LangChain's DocumentLoader to extract text from a PDF document.

#### STEP 2: Create a Vector Store
Convert the text into vector embeddings using a language model, enabling semantic search.

#### STEP 3: Initialize the LangChain QA Pipeline
Use LangChain's RetrievalQA to connect the vector store with a language model for answering questions.

#### STEP 4: Handle User Queries
Process user queries, retrieve relevant document sections, and generate responses.

#### STEP 5: Evaluate Effectiveness
Test the chatbot with a variety of queries to assess accuracy and reliability.


### PROGRAM:
```
import os
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

# File name
file_path = "tech.pdf"

# Confirm file existence and load
if os.path.isfile(file_path):
    loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)
    pages = loader.load()
    print("PDF loaded successfully.")
    print(pages[0].page_content if pages else "PDF is empty.")

from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
persist_directory = 'docs/chroma/'
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma(persist_directory=persist_directory, embedding_function=embedding)

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-4', temperature=0)

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Use three sentences maximum. Keep the answer as concise as possible. Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer. 
{context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:"""
QA_CHAIN_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["context", "question"],template=template,)

from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
question = "what is the definition of technology"
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm,
                                       retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(),
                                       return_source_documents=True,
                                       chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": QA_CHAIN_PROMPT})

result = qa_chain({"query": question})
print("Question: ", question)
print("Answer: ", result["result"])

### RESULT:
Thus, a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain was implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content successfully.
